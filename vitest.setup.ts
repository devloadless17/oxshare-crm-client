/*
 * jsdom shims that Radix UI needs.
 *
 * Radix's Select (and Dropdown, Popover…) drives its open/close through the
 * Pointer Events API and scrolls the highlighted item into view. jsdom implements
 * none of these, so without the stubs below a `click` on a SelectTrigger does
 * nothing at all: the portal never mounts, no `option` role ever appears, and a
 * test asserting on the menu fails as though the component were broken.
 *
 * These are the four the components in this app actually reach for. Keep them here
 * rather than per-test, because Select is on a dozen screens.
