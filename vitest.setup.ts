/*
 * `findBy*` and `waitFor` poll for 5s, not testing-library's default 1s.
 *
 * The default left the harness self-contradictory: vitest allows 20s per test
 * (`testTimeout` in vitest.config.mts), while every async DOM query inside it
 * gave up after ONE second. A screen whose React Query promise had not resolved
 * in that window failed with "Unable to find an element with the text …" and a
 * DOM dump still showing the loading spinner — which reads as a rendering bug in
 * the component, not as a query that was never given time to settle.
 *
 * That is exactly how it presented: the admin directory's suspended-status test
 * failed on a loaded machine while the other thirteen in the same file passed,
 * and passed again on re-run. Time spent reading it as a product defect is the
 * real cost of the mismatch.
 *
 * 10s is a polling CEILING, not a delay — a query that resolves immediately still
 * returns immediately, so the suite does not get slower. It keeps a 2x margin
 * under `testTimeout` so a genuinely stuck query still fails as a timeout with a
 * useful message rather than hitting the outer limit.
 *
 * The first test in a file is the one that fails, which is the tell: it pays the
 * module-import and first-render cost inside its own polling budget. On a busy
 * machine that import bill runs to minutes of CPU across workers, so 1s — and
 * even 5s — could be spent before the component had rendered at all.

 * dependency rather than a missing shim, which is the expensive way to find it.
 *
 * `matches: false` for every query is the right default, not an arbitrary one:
 * it means "no media condition applies", so components take their base
 * behaviour. For the carousel that resolves `prefers-reduced-motion` to false
 * and the animation stays on, which is the state worth exercising — a test run
 * under "reduced motion" would silently skip the movement it means to check.
 *
 * A test needing a specific answer should stub `window.matchMedia` itself for
 * the duration; this only stops the absence of the API from being an error.
