/**
 * A PARTIAL RUN MUST NOT BE ABLE TO REPORT SUCCESS.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * When vitest cannot start a worker — "Failed to start forks worker", which is
 * what happens when the machine is short of memory — it records an unhandled
 * error, reports the files that DID run as passing, and **exits 0**.
 *
 * Measured on this repo, 10 Sep 2026, uncapped on a busy machine:
 *
 *   17 of 38 files, 165 tests, 21 errors, exit 0
 *   23 of 38 files, 251 tests, 15 errors, exit 0
 *
 * Both are green as far as CI is concerned. The suite answered a question about
 * under half of itself while presenting as complete, and the two runs disagree
 * with each other because the answer depends on how much RAM happened to be
 * free — so the same commit "passes" differently on a busy box and a quiet one.
 *
 * `maxWorkers` in `vitest.config.mts` makes that unlikely. It does not make it
 * impossible: a busier machine, a heavier suite or a future default can bring it
 * back, and it would come back SILENTLY, which is the only reason it went
 * unnoticed for as long as it did.
 *
 * ## Why a floor rather than an exact count
 *
 * An exact count fails every time somebody adds a test file, which trains people
 * to edit the number without reading it — the failure mode of every register in
 * this system. A floor only fails when the suite gets SMALLER, which is either a
 * deleted file (deliberate, so lower the floor in the same commit) or a file that
 * did not run (the bug this catches).
 *
 * Same convention as the coverage thresholds: pinned just under the measured
 * number, and it may only ever go UP.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not assert a test COUNT. Test counts move for legitimate reasons on
 * every commit — a `describe.skipIf` that skips a block in one environment and
 * runs it in another is correct behaviour, not a truncated run. The FILE count is
 * the stable signal: a file either collected or it did not.
