# Compares the "twin" files against the sibling app.
#
# Twin files are deliberate copies at identical paths in oxshare-crm-admin and
# oxshare-crm-client. There is no shared package: the real duplication is ~150
# near-static lines, against which a fourth repo, a registry decision, versioning
# discipline and an npm-link dev loop is a bad trade (and react-query already
# drifts between the two, so lockstep upgrades would bite immediately).
#
# What is compared is CODE, not prose: comments legitimately differ (each points
# at the other repo, and each explains that repo's history). A difference in a
# code line means the copies have actually diverged.
#
# Advisory by design — exits 0 with a warning if the sibling is missing, and is
# never wired into CI, because CI must not depend on a sibling checkout existing.

# NOT a twin, deliberately: src/components/async-boundary.tsx.
# Same props and same four branches. The loader is no longer the reason — both
# apps now render components/ui/loader, which IS a twin. What still differs is
# the error branch: admin surfaces the API's own message via apiErrorMessage(),
# because R-2.5 makes an unrecognised filter a 400 whose sentence tells the
# operator what they got wrong, and the portal shows a generic line to a client
# for whom that sentence means nothing. They also use different i18n keys for
# the forbidden state. Keep the PROPS and the branch behaviour in step by hand.
#
# NOT a twin, deliberately: src/lib/api/client.ts.
# Its structure is parallel and its config block is delimited the same way, but two
# differences are irreducible rather than configurable — the exported names
# (clearAdminSession/refreshAdminToken vs clearSession/refreshPortalToken, used
# across both apps) and the token casing (the admin API answers accessToken, the
# portal answers access_token — a frozen backend divergence). Listing it here
# would make this check assert something untrue, so it is reviewed by hand.
# NOT a twin any more, deliberately: src/components/ui/button.tsx.
# It was one, and the portal has since removed the scale-on-press feedback from
# the base class — press feedback in the client portal is colour only, decided
# for the customer-facing app alone. Admin keeps its press effect. Listing it
# here would report that divergence as drift on every run, which trains the
# reader to ignore this check's output; the SHAPE of the file (variants, sizes,
# asChild, the props interface) is still meant to match and is reviewed by hand.
#
# NOT a twin any more, deliberately: src/components/backend-pending.tsx.
# It stopped rendering the endpoint names it is handed. `GET /platforms` is
# internal vocabulary, and this is the CUSTOMER-facing app: it means nothing to
# the client reading it and publishes the API surface to anyone who opens an
# unfinished page. Admin's readers are the people who own those endpoints, so
# the chips still earn their place there. Same props, same four call sites.
# src/components/theme-toggle.tsx is delisted too, and deleted from this repo:
# the account menu grew its own theme submenu (see layout/user-menu.tsx) and
# the standalone toggle had no importer left. admin/ still uses and keeps its
# copy — this is a portal-only removal, not shared drift.
#
# The three *.test.ts twins are gone from this list, not from the siblings.
# The portal has no test suite any more, so those files do not exist HERE —
# the loop below skips a missing file silently, which would have quietly
# shrunk the comparison from 17 files to 14 with nothing saying so. Removed
# explicitly instead. admin/ still has its copies and still compares them.
