# OxShare client portal — production image (Next.js `output: 'standalone'`).
#
# The two NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are BAKED IN at build time. Next inlines them into
# the browser bundle AND into src/proxy.ts, which builds every response's CSP, so
# the API's domain is part of the image. A new domain is a REBUILD, never a
# restart: a restart changes nothing and looks exactly like the value being
# ignored. The build refuses to run without them rather than ship a portal that
# calls localhost.
#
#   docker build \
#     --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com \
#     --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_ORIGIN=https://api.example.com \
#     -t oxshare-portal:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) .
#
# In production both are the API's origin: realtime reaches uWebSockets through
# the API host (its Caddy routes /socket.io/* to :3003), never a port of its own.
#
# bookworm-slim, not alpine: Next's image optimiser loads sharp's glibc build.

# npm 11, PINNED, for the reason the backend's Dockerfile gives at length: the
# npm bundled with node:22 (10.9) re-resolves a lockfile that carries `overrides`
# against the registry's latest, so `npm ci` starts refusing it on an upstream
# patch release with no commit involved. This package.json overrides js-yaml.
#
# "prepare": "husky" needs a .git the build context does not carry. npm ci
# reconciles dependencies, not scripts, so deleting it keeps the lockfile in step.
