# Deploying the client portal

A push to `production` runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: **verify → build → deploy**, and
deploys THIS app only. The admin lives on the same server and is never touched by this
repo's deploy.

| `API_ORIGIN`      | The API's origin, `https://` and no trailing slash, e.g. `https://oxshareapi.loadless.site`. **Baked into the image** (bundle and CSP): a change needs a rebuild |

Both domains set the SAME values in both frontend repos: each deploy writes the domains into
the server's `.env`.

Before the first deploy, create `<DOCKER_USERNAME>/oxshare-crm-portal` on Docker Hub as **private**: the
build refuses a public or missing repository.

## What a deploy does

1. Builds the image with `API_ORIGIN` baked in, and pushes both tags.
2. Copies `deploy/docker-compose.yml` and `deploy/Caddyfile` to `~/oxshare-web/`.
3. Rewrites ONLY the `PORTAL_IMAGE` line of the server's `.env` (the admin's line is left as it is).
4. Pulls, recreates the `portal` container, reloads Caddy, and waits for `portal` to be healthy.
5. Keeps the previous image (the rollback target) and removes older ones.

Caddy holds a request for up to 10 s while the container restarts, so a release shows no
error page (232 of 232 requests answered 200 during a rehearsed redeploy, 5 Oct 2026).

## Rollback

```bash
ssh oxshare-web
cd oxshare-web
docker images "*/oxshare-crm-portal"                       # the previous tag is still here
sed -i "s|^PORTAL_IMAGE=.*|PORTAL_IMAGE='<user>/oxshare-crm-portal:<previous sha>'|" .env
docker compose up -d portal
```

Or re-run the workflow from the older commit.

## Verifying a release

```bash
curl -sI https://<PORTAL_DOMAIN>/favicon.ico | head -1     # HTTP/2 200
```

Then, in a browser on the deployed site: **log in → hard refresh → a write**
(DEPLOY-PLAYBOOK §9d). Login alone proves nothing; the refresh makes the app rebuild its
session from the cookies, which is exactly what differs between hosts.

## The server

Built by `deploy/provision-server.sh` in the backend repo with `ROLE=web`; its DEPLOYMENT.md
says how to replace it, and what changes when the buyer's domain arrives.

## Things that will bite if changed casually

- **The admin, the portal and the API must share ONE registrable domain** (backend
  DEPLOYMENT.md, "Where the frontends must live"): sessions are `__Host-` cookies with
  `SameSite=Lax`.
- **Never publish an app port.** Docker bypasses UFW, so a published port is open to the
  internet whatever the firewall says. Only Caddy publishes.
- **The `caddy_data` volume holds the certificates.** Deleting it forces re-issuance, which
  Let's Encrypt rate-limits per week.
- **`deploy/` is a twin.** Change it in both frontend repos together.
