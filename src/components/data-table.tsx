 * It used to be `rounded-xl border bg-card p-12` — a card, because it was
 * rendered INSTEAD of the table and had to supply its own frame. In `fill` mode
 * `DataTable` now renders it inside the table body instead (see the empty row
 * there), so a bordered card here would paint a second border inside the table's
 * own: a box in a box, with the column headers above it.
 *
 * `h-full` plus `flex … items-center justify-center` is what centres it on both
 * axes inside that cell. `min-h-[12rem]` is the floor for the document-flow
 * case, where `DataTable` still returns this on its own and there is no height
 * to fill — without it a bare message would be a single line of text with no
 * presence at all.
