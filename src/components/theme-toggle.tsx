/**
 * Light or dark — ONE icon, beside the notification bell.
 *
 * ## What it replaced, and why
 *
 * Theme used to be a "Theme ▸" row inside the account menu offering Light, Dark
 * and System. The client asked for exactly two states and for the control to sit
 * in the header beside the bell, as on the broker's existing site — a preference
 * you change often should be one click, not three levels into a menu.
 *
 * ## What "no System" means here
 *
 * The CHOICE is gone; the first-visit default is not. Before anyone has picked,
 * the page still follows the device (next-themes' own default), so a phone in
 * dark mode opens dark. The first click then pins an explicit `light` or
 * `dark`, and that is what the page keeps. A visitor who had picked "System"
 * previously still resolves to their device's scheme and flips out of it the
 * same way.
 *
 * ## The icon is the DESTINATION
 *
 * A moon on a light page, a sun on a dark one — the convention the reference
 * site uses, and the one that reads as a button rather than a status light. The
 * accessible name says the same thing in words ("Switch to dark mode"), because
 * an icon alone announces nothing.
 *
 * Decided from `resolvedTheme`, never `theme`: `theme` is `"system"` until
 * the first click, which is neither answer.
 *
 * ## Before hydration
 *
 * The server cannot know the stored theme, so the first render is a box of the
 * same size with no icon — no layout shift, and no wrong icon flashed for a frame
 * and then swapped.
