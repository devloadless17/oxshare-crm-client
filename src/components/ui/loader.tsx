/**
 * The one loading indicator in this app.
 *
 * TWIN FILE — an identical copy lives at the same path in oxshare-crm-admin.
 * Behaviour changes belong in both.
 *
 * Before this there were fourteen spellings of "please wait": lucide's
 * `Loader2` at five different sizes and four different colours, a
 * border-and-`animate-spin` div in `RequireAuth`, and a `RefreshCw` that spun
 * only sometimes. They disagreed on size, on colour, on whether a screen reader
 * heard anything, and on what happened under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * ## Why a hand-written SVG rather than an icon from the set
 *
 * `currentColor`. A loader lives inside a control whose foreground it cannot
 * know — on `variant="default"` it must be primary-foreground, on `outline` and
 * `ghost` it must be the ordinary text colour, and inside a destructive button
 * it must be white. An icon with a baked-in `text-primary` is right on exactly
 * one of those and invisible on at least one other. Inheriting is the only
 * thing that is right everywhere, and it costs eight lines of SVG.
 *
 * The track/arc split matters for the same reason: a bare arc on a busy button
 * reads as a rendering glitch, while a faint full ring behind it reads as a
 * dial. `opacity-25` on the track keeps it legible on both themes without
 * needing a colour of its own.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * `loader-spin` is defined in `globals.css` and is NOT `animate-spin`. Do not
 * swap it back: the blanket reduced-motion rule in that file sets
 * `animation-duration: 0.001ms !important` on everything, which finishes
 * `animate-spin` instantly and leaves a frozen arc for every user whose OS has
 * "reduce motion" on. `loader-spin` re-asserts the rotation past that rule, so
 * it spins in both settings. The reasoning lives with the keyframes.

 *
 * `label` is an ALREADY-RESOLVED string, not a MessageKey. A key would be the
 * stricter signature, and it would not fit: `AsyncBoundary` — the busiest
 * caller — takes a `label: string` from screens that have already called `t()`,
 * often with interpolation. Matching that is worth more than a type that
 * forbids a literal here while every neighbouring component allows one.
 *
 * `srOnly` hides the label visually while keeping it announced, which is what a
