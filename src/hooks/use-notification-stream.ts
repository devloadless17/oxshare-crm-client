 * the session cookie is sent), and the browser owns reconnection. The server
 * closes each stream after fifteen minutes so the next connect
 * re-authenticates through the full guard chain.

 * The bell keeps a slow poll underneath this. When the stream is proven live
 * the poll is pointless and is backed off; when it is not — SSE blocked by a
 * corporate proxy, the listener down, the browser out of connections — the
 * poll carries the feature at its old cadence. So the degradation is to
 * "slower", never to "silent".
