   * Only ever true alongside `status: 'ready'` — a screen with no data at all
   * is an ERROR, and that is what the other five states are for. This is the
   * case none of them covers: the query HAS data, a refresh was attempted, and
   * it did not land.
   *
   * ── Why this cannot be read off the query ──────────────────────────────────
   *
   * It was measured, twice and in both apps, because the answer is not what
   * anyone expects. After a failed BACKGROUND refetch TanStack reports:
   *
   *   status success · isError false · fetchStatus idle · failureCount 0
   *   failureReason null · errorUpdateCount 0 · errorUpdatedAt 0 · error null
   *
   * Every field clean. A query that has just failed to refresh is indis-
   * tinguishable from one that succeeded, so `AsyncBoundary` renders the happy
   * branch over stale data and nothing anywhere says so. The only channel
   * TanStack offers is the value `refetch()` RESOLVES with — which reaches the
   * one caller that happened to await it, and no one else.
   *
   * So this is tracked here, in the one place every screen already goes
   * through. An ABORT is deliberately not a failure: React Query cancels
   * superseded requests on every keystroke of a search box, and counting those
   * would make the flag permanently true on exactly the screens that use it
   * most — a declaration that is always true is as useless as one that is
   * always false.
   *
   * ── Why it matters more here than it sounds ───────────────────────────────
   *
   * On a list of clients, stale means slightly old. On a WALLET it means a
   * BALANCE that is not the balance — and this project has already shipped that
   * failure twice from the other direction: a wallet reading `$0.00` to
   * somebody holding $700, and an accounts page telling a client with three
   * live accounts they had none. Both were fixed by making the screen render
   * what the database actually said. This is the third way to get there, and
   * the only one the six states could not express.

   * ── A FAILED REFRESH OVER DATA WE ALREADY HAVE IS NOT AN ERROR ────────────
   *
   * `query.isError` goes TRUE when a BACKGROUND refetch fails, even though the
   * previous answer is still in `data`. Deriving the status from `isError`
   * alone therefore replaced a populated screen with an error card on any
   * transient blip — a balance swapped for "something went wrong" because one
   * poll missed.
   *
   * ⚠️ AND IT DID IT NON-DETERMINISTICALLY, which is why it went unnoticed and
   * why two separate measurements of it were wrong. Read the observer straight
   * after the failed refetch and it still says `success`; force ANY unrelated
   * re-render — a sibling's state, a parent, a modal opening — and the same
   * query reports `error` with the data still sitting there. Measured:
   *
   *   AFTER REFETCH: success/isError=false | AFTER UNRELATED RE-RENDER: error/isError=true
   *
   * So whether a screen showed stale data or an error page depended on whether
   * something else happened to re-render it. Both outcomes were reachable from
   * the same failure, which is worse than either one.
   *
   * The rule below is deterministic: data we hold keeps being shown, and the
   * failure is reported through `refreshFailed` instead of by blanking the
   * screen. That is the same principle as the wallet card's — render what the
   * server actually said, never an invented emptiness.
   *
   * THE EXCEPTION IS AUTHORIZATION. A 401 or a 403 arriving on a refresh is not
   * a blip, it is the answer changing: the session ended, or the permission was
   * taken away. Continuing to show rows to somebody who has just been refused
   * them is exactly the leak RBAC-03 exists to prevent, so those two win over
   * the data we hold.
