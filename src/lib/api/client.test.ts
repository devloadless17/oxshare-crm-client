/**
 * The 401/refresh interceptor — the piece of this app most able to break a
 * session, and the one with no test.
 *
 * TWIN of oxshare-crm-admin/src/lib/api/client.test.ts. `client.ts` is a
 * near-twin: the behaviour is identical and only the exported names, the
 * per-surface cookie and the endpoint paths differ. The admin side had this
 * suite and the portal had none, so the same three defects were possible here
 * and nothing would have caught them.
 *
 * Three properties matter, and each one has a specific failure behind it:
 *
 *  - **Single-flight.** Refresh ROTATES the refresh token, so N concurrent 401s
 *    firing N rotations means the 2nd..Nth present an already-rotated token,
 *    fail, and log the client out mid-session. This is the bug the `inFlight`
 *    promise exists to prevent, and nothing regressed it.
 *
 *  - **Retry exactly once.** `_retry` is the only thing standing between a
 *    persistent 401 and an infinite request loop against the API.
 *
 *  - **Never on an auth endpoint.** A failed login answers 401 by design. If the
 *    interceptor treated that as an expired session it would attempt a refresh
 *    on every wrong password, and on failure hard-navigate — turning "wrong
 *    password" into a page reload that discards the typed email.
 *
 * `axios.post` is mocked rather than the network, because the refresh call
 * deliberately bypasses `apiClient` (it must not recurse through this same
 * interceptor).
 */

/*
 * The spy is created in `vi.hoisted` and referenced directly rather than read
 * back off `axios.post`. Reading it back trips `unbound-method` — correctly,
 * since detaching a method from its object is normally a bug — and `.bind()`ing
 * it produces a DIFFERENT function, so assertions would watch a copy that never
 * records anything.
