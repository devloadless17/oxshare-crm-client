 * returns it in the error envelope as `requestId`. Surfacing it next to an error
 * message is what turns "it failed" into a support ticket someone can actually
 * grep for — the backend's own 500 message asks the user to quote it.
 *
 * Reads the response header as well as the body, because a 502 from a proxy in
