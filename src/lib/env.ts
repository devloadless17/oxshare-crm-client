/**
 * Configuration, validated once at module load — PLATFORM-CONVENTIONS R-8.5.
 *
 * TWIN of the same path in the sibling app. Behaviour changes belong in both;
 * `scripts/check-twins.sh` compares everything outside the `twin:config` block.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `client.ts` read the API host as
 *
 *     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
 *
 * so a deployment that forgot the variable started perfectly and then talked to
 * localhost. The failure surfaces at the first server-rendered request as a
 * connection refused, far from the missing config that caused it — and in the
 * worse case where something IS listening on 3001, it succeeds against the
 * wrong backend.
 *
 * The backend already refuses to boot on bad config (`src/config/env.validation.ts`,
 * zod). The frontends were the half of that rule nobody had implemented. This
 * closes it in the same shape: state what is required, fail loudly, and fail at
 * startup rather than at first use.
 *
 * ## Why the localhost default is kept in development
 *
 * It is correct there, and it is what makes `npm run dev` work with no `.env` —
 * the three-terminal workflow in the root CLAUDE.md depends on it. What was
 * wrong was applying that convenience to production, where an unset variable is
 * a mistake and not a default. So the fallback survives, scoped to where it is
 * true.

/*
 * THE BROWSER CALLS THE API DIRECTLY. It no longer goes through the `/api`
 * rewrite, and that is a security decision rather than a preference.
 *
 * The rewrite made every call same-origin, so the API's `Set-Cookie` reached the
 * browser through the FRONTEND's host and the session was stored there. The
 * realtime socket cannot use a rewrite — Vercel serves rewrites from serverless
 * functions, which cannot hold a WebSocket open — so it dials the API host
 * directly, found no cookie for that host, and every handshake was refused with
 * only a warning to show for it.
 *
 * Calling the API directly puts the cookie where the socket looks for it, and
 * keeps the session in an httpOnly `__Host-` cookie that JavaScript can never
 * read. The alternative — a token in the handshake — would work under any
 * topology but hands XSS something worth stealing.
 *
 * THE DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT THIS CREATES: the frontend and the API must be
 * SIBLING SUBDOMAINS of one registrable domain — `portal.example.com` and
 * `api.example.com`. `SameSite=Lax` sends a cookie on a same-SITE request and
 * withholds it on a cross-site one, and `*.vercel.app` is its own registrable
 * domain, so a Vercel-hosted frontend on the default URL is cross-site from the
 * API and gets no cookie at all. DEPLOYMENT.md states this; it is the one thing
 * that must be true wherever this is hosted.
