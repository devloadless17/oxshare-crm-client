/**
 * The per-request `script-src`, with a nonce — the half of the CSP that cannot
 * be a static header.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `next.config.ts` carried `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`, and the
 * `'unsafe-inline'` was not laziness: Next emits inline bootstrap and hydration
 * scripts on every page, so removing it without a nonce yields a blank screen.
 *
 * But while it is there, the rest of the policy buys very little against the
 * threat it exists for. `'unsafe-inline'` means any injected `<script>` runs —
 * and on this origin that script can act as the signed-in admin: the session
 * cookies are `httpOnly` so it cannot READ them, but the browser attaches them
 * to every request it makes, and the anti-forgery token is deliberately readable
 * by JS. Approving a withdrawal is a fetch away.
 *
 * A nonce closes it: only tags carrying this exact value run, and an attacker
 * injecting markup cannot guess a value minted after their payload was stored.
 *
 * ── Why it must be per REQUEST ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A nonce reused across responses is not a nonce. If it were in
 * `next.config.ts` it would be one constant baked at build time, which an
 * attacker reads once from any page and embeds in their payload forever — a
 * policy that looks strict and enforces nothing. That is the whole reason this
 * lives in middleware rather than beside the other headers.
