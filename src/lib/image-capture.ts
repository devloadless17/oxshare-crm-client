/**
 * Preparing a phone photo of an identity document for upload.
 *
 * ## The three problems this solves, and why they are one function
 *
 * 1. **Orientation.** Phone photos are stored in the sensor's native rotation
 *    with an EXIF tag saying how to turn them. Nothing in this system applied
 *    it — not the portal, not the upload path, not the admin viewer — so a
 *    reviewer regularly received a sideways ID, rejected it as unreadable, and
 *    the client was asked days later to re-photograph a document that was
 *    perfectly legible and merely rotated.
 *
 * 2. **GPS.** The same EXIF block routinely carries the coordinates where the
 *    photo was taken, the device serial and the capture time. Nobody chose to
 *    collect a client's home location; it is what happens when a camera
 *    original is stored verbatim.
 *
 * 3. **Size.** A modern phone camera produces 3–12 MB. Over mobile data that is
 *    minutes of upload, and past 10 MB it is refused outright — which, for
 *    someone who cannot resize a photo on a phone, is where signup is abandoned.
 *
 * All three are fixed by the same act: decode the image, draw it to a canvas in
 * its correct orientation, and re-encode. Doing them separately would mean
 * decoding the same multi-megabyte image three times.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT altered
 *
 * An image already within the size cap is **not scaled**. Its pixels are the
 * pixels the client captured. The re-encode still happens — that is what applies
 * the rotation and drops the GPS block — but nothing is thrown away for the sake
 * of a smaller file.
 *
 * `MAX_EDGE` is set well above what a reviewer needs rather than at it: 2000px
 * on the long edge is roughly 250 dpi across a passport bio page, comfortably
 * enough to read a machine-readable zone, and several times a 300 dpi scan of an
 * ID card's short dimension. The compression is high-quality for the same
 * reason. This is a compliance document, so the bias is towards keeping detail
 * and paying for it in bytes.
 *
 * Non-images — a PDF bank statement — are passed through untouched. There is
 * nothing to orient, no EXIF to strip, and rasterising a PDF would destroy the
 * one format that is already both small and sharp.
 */

/** The longest edge we will store. See the note above on why it is generous. */
export const MAX_EDGE = 2000;

/**
 * Below this, a document is likely to come back rejected as unreadable.
 *
 * A WARNING threshold, never a block. 1000px on the long edge is about 125 dpi
 * across an ID card — poor, but sometimes legible, and a legitimate small scan
 * refused outright is a worse outcome than a marginal one a reviewer can judge.
 * The client is told; the decision stays with the human who can actually see it.

 * and the uploader would sit on "preparing" with no way out. That is not
 * hypothetical — it is what the fallback path does in an environment with no
 * image loading, and a browser that fails to decode a corrupt file can behave
 * the same way.
 *
 * Generous, because decoding a 12 MP image on a mid-range phone is genuinely
 * slow: this is a stuck-detector, not a performance budget.
