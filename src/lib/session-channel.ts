/**
 * Cross-tab session coordination.
 *
 * Two defects share one cause — nothing in this app knew another tab existed:
 *
 *  - **Signing out in one tab left every other tab fully rendered.** The hard
 *    navigation ends the tab it runs in; the others keep their React Query cache
 *    and their chrome, and — because the eviction was gated on a CSRF cookie the
 *    logout had just cleared — never corrected even on their next request. The
 *    client's name, email and wallet balance stayed on screen indefinitely, on a
 *    machine they believe they signed out of.
 *
 *  - **Two tabs could rotate one refresh token concurrently.** The single-flight
 *    lock in `client.ts` is module scope, which is per TAB. Each tab also runs
 *    its own ten-minute timer, so a laptop waking with two tabs open fires two
 *    refreshes at once — and this portal's primary device is a phone, where
 *    waking with several tabs open is the normal case rather than the unusual
 *    one. Before the backend's grace window the whole token family could be
 *    destroyed with a credential-theft alert.
 *
 * ## Why `BroadcastChannel` and Web Locks rather than `localStorage`
 *
 * A `storage` event fires only in OTHER tabs and only for a real value change,
 * so it needs a nonce to avoid being swallowed as a no-op write, and it cannot
 * express mutual exclusion at all. `BroadcastChannel` is the right shape for a
 * notification and Web Locks is the right shape for a lock. Both are supported
 * in every browser this portal targets.
 *
 * **Everything degrades to the previous behaviour** when either API is missing:
 * `announce` becomes a no-op and `withSessionLock` runs the callback directly.
 * A tab that cannot coordinate is exactly as correct as it was before this file
 * existed — which is the only acceptable failure mode for a shim like this.

/**
 * Who sent a message, so a document never acts on its own announcement.
 *
 * `BroadcastChannel` does not deliver a message back to the channel OBJECT that
 * sent it — but it does deliver to every other object with the same name in the
 * same origin, INCLUDING other objects in the same document. `announceSessionEvent`
 * opens a short-lived channel to post; `onSessionEvent` holds a separate
 * long-lived one. They are two objects, so the listener heard its own tab.
 *
 * That produced an infinite reload after signing out, and it is worth spelling
 * out because it is not obvious from either function on its own:
 *
 *   land on /auth/login → `/auth/me` 401 → refresh fails → `endDeadSession`
 *   announces 'signed-out' → THIS document's own listener hears it → hard
 *   navigation to /auth/login → and round again, forever.
 *
 * The reload also aborted whatever request was in flight, which surfaced as
 * "Cannot reach OxShare" on a perfectly healthy API — the loop wearing the
 * costume of the very failure state this work added.
 *
 * A per-document id fixes it at the source rather than by adding guards at each
 * call site, which would have to be remembered by the next caller.
