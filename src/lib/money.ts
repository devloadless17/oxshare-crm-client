 * Money formatting for display. Strings in, strings out — never a JS number.

 * in code, and serialized as strings across every API boundary. The backend
 * holds up its end (`money()` in wallet/money.ts returns a fixed-scale string),
 * so the only way to lose precision on this side is to convert.
 *
 * That is exactly what `Number(balance).toFixed(2)` and
 * `balance.toLocaleString()` do, and it is why neither appears here:
 * `Number('12345678901234567.89')` is already wrong before formatting starts.
 * `Intl.NumberFormat` is also out — it takes a number.
 *
 * TWIN FILE — an identical copy belongs at the same path in oxshare-crm-admin
 * if the admin app ever renders client-facing balances. Behaviour changes belong
 * in both.

 *    '100.00000000'. That is the specific bug admin's `sortType: 'money'` was
 *    added to close, and a client sorting their own transactions by amount would
 *    hit it on the first list containing both single- and triple-digit values.

 *
 * A decimal string made readable WITHOUT pretending to be money: no symbol, no
 * currency suffix, and no fixed scale.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `formatMoney`
 *
 * `formatMoney` rounds to two places and appends a currency, which is right for
 * a balance and wrong for everything else on a trading row. A price is not
 * money — a JPY pair quotes to three places and most others to five, so a fixed
 * 2dp would round `1.08337` to `1.08` and hide the digits somebody is reading
 * the row for. Lots are not money either.
 *
 * So: keep every significant digit, drop the trailing zeros that are storage
 * scale rather than information, and group the thousands. `157.4200000000` is
 * `NUMERIC(28,10)` doing its job; it is not a number to put in front of a
 * person.
 *
 * ## Still never coerced
 *
 * decimal.js parses it, exactly as `formatMoney` does — §6.1 applies to every
 * decimal string on these paths, not only the ones denominated in a currency.
 * An unparseable value returns the fallback rather than `NaN`.
