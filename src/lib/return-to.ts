/**
 * "Where was this client trying to go", encoded into a URL and decoded safely.
 *
 * NOT a route guard. Route gating — which paths are public, which are private,
 * who gets redirected where — lives entirely in `src/proxy.ts` and nowhere else.
 * This module answers a narrower question that four unrelated places all need to
 * answer identically:
 *
 *   proxy.ts                    writes `?next=` when it bounces a visitor
 *   auth/login/page.tsx         reads it after a successful sign-in
 *   components/auth/*           reads it when the client gate redirects
 *   lib/api/client.ts           writes it when a session dies mid-request
 *
 * `proxy.ts` cannot be the home for it, because it imports `next/server` and is
 * compiled for the edge runtime — importing it from a client component would
 * drag the middleware into the browser bundle. So the encoding lives here, and
 * the routing decisions live there.
 *
 * The reason it is a module at all rather than four inline snippets is the
 * `safeReturnTo` half. That is an open-redirect check, and an open-redirect
 * check that exists in four slightly different copies is an open redirect.

 * The `next` parameter, made safe to navigate to — or the dashboard.

 * are the ones who put it there: anybody can send a client a link to
 * `/auth/login?next=https://evil.example/login`, and a portal that redirects
 * there after a successful sign-in has handed over a phishing page wearing our
 * own flow. That is a textbook open redirect, and it is worth more here than on
 * most sites, because the page the victim arrives at is the one they reach in
 * the instant after typing their password.
 *
 * Resolved through `URL` against an opaque base rather than pattern-matched,
 * because the browser's own parser is the authority on what a string navigates
 * to and hand-rolled checks keep losing to it. `//evil.example` is
 * protocol-relative, `/\evil.example` is treated as `//` by every browser, and
 * `\/\/evil.example` is too. One parse settles all of them: if the resolved
 * origin is not the opaque base, the string was never same-origin.
