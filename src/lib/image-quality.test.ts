/**
 * The selfie quality hint, and the two ways it must fail SAFELY.
 *
 * It is not a security control — it runs in the client's browser and
 * `POST /kyc/upload` takes any JPEG from anyone — so nothing here asserts that a
 * bad frame is refused. What is asserted is the opposite pair: an ordinary photo
 * is waved through, and anything unmeasurable is waved through too.
 *
 * A gate that refuses a usable photo is worse than no gate. The client cannot
 * see what it saw, cannot argue with it, and has no way forward.
 *
 * Written against `measureQuality` (pixels) rather than `findQualityProblem`
 * (canvas) on purpose: jsdom has no 2D context, so canvas-based cases SKIP — and
 * a skipped test reports as PASSING. Four skipped cases would have read as
 * coverage while checking nothing.
