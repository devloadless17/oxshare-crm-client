/**
 * The bell's sound, synthesised rather than fetched.
 *
 * ## Why no audio file
 *
 * A two-note chime is about forty lines of Web Audio and zero bytes over the
 * network. An `.mp3` would mean a public asset, a `media-src` entry in the CSP
 * (which is `'self'`-only and deliberately tight), a request that can fail,
 * and a decision about licensing. None of that buys a better sound at this
 * length.
 *
 * ## Autoplay policy is a fact, not a bug
 *
 * Browsers refuse audio until the user has interacted with the page, so the
 * first notification after a cold load may be silent — and there is nothing to
 * be done about that, correctly: it is what stops pages screaming at people.
 * The context is created lazily on the first play attempt and resumed if it is
 * suspended, so sound starts working from the first click, keypress or scroll
 * onward. A refusal is swallowed: a bell that throws because it could not make
 * a noise is worse than a quiet bell.
 *
 * ## Sound is never the only signal
 *
 * The badge, the row and the unread marker all render regardless. This is an
 * addition for someone looking elsewhere, not a channel anything depends on —
 * which is what makes it safe for it to be silently unavailable.
 *
 * TWIN FILE with the admin console's `lib/notification-sound.ts` (registered in
 * check-twins). Only the DEFAULT differs, and that lives in the config block
 * below rather than in the logic.

// ─── twin:config:start ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/*
 * OFF by default here, unlike the admin console's copy.
 *
 * A client has the portal open incidentally — beside their work, on a phone in
 * a pocket — and a noise from a page nobody was looking at is startling rather
 * than useful. It is also the surest way to have the feature muted permanently
 * on day one, which costs the signal entirely. Operators, who sit ON the
 * console watching queues, get it on.
