/**
 * The bell's sound, synthesised rather than fetched.
 *
 * ## Why no audio file
 *
 * A two-note chime is about forty lines of Web Audio and zero bytes over the
 * network. An `.mp3` would mean a public asset, a `media-src` entry in the CSP
 * (which is `'self'`-only and deliberately tight), a request that can fail,
 * and a decision about licensing. None of that buys a better sound at this
 * length.
 *
 * ## Autoplay policy is a fact, not a bug
 *
 * Browsers refuse audio until the user has interacted with the page, so a
 * notification arriving before the reader has touched anything is silent — and
 * there is nothing to be done about that, correctly: it is what stops pages
 * screaming at people.
 *
 * What IS done about it is `primeNotificationSound`, which builds and resumes
 * the context on the first click, keypress or tap rather than waiting for the
 * first notification to need it. Without that the first chime was inaudible
 * even long after the gesture requirement was satisfied, because `resume()` is
 * asynchronous and the oscillators were already scheduled — so the sound
 * appeared to start working only from the second notification onward.
 *
 * A refusal is swallowed either way: a bell that throws because it could not
 * make a noise is worse than a quiet bell.
 *
 * ## Sound is never the only signal
 *
 * The badge, the row and the unread marker all render regardless. This is an
 * addition for someone looking elsewhere, not a channel anything depends on —
 * which is what makes it safe for it to be silently unavailable.
 *
 * TWIN FILE with the admin console's `lib/notification-sound.ts` (registered in
 * check-twins). Only the DEFAULT differs, and that lives in the config block
 * below rather than in the logic.

/*
 * ON by default, matching the admin console.
 *
 * This reverses the earlier default, and the reasoning it reversed is recorded
 * here because it was not wrong: a client has the portal open incidentally —
 * beside their work, on a phone in a pocket — and a noise from a page nobody
 * was looking at is startling. What decided it the other way is what the
 * portal's events actually ARE. A client hears this chime when their deposit
 * lands, their withdrawal is approved, or their identity check passes: a
 * handful of moments they are explicitly waiting on, not a queue that ticks all
 * day. Defaulting those to silent meant the feature existed for the fraction of
 * clients who found the toggle.
 *
 * The toggle is still in the bell header, still remembered per browser, and
 * still tab-wide — so muting it is one click for anyone this bothers, which is
 * the cost that makes the louder default defensible.

 * Build and resume the AudioContext on the reader's FIRST interaction with the

 *
 * ## What this fixes
 *
 * Autoplay policy is still a fact and this does not defeat it. The problem it
 * solves is one of TIMING. A context created inside `playNotificationSound`
 * starts `suspended`, and `resume()` is asynchronous — so the very first chime
 * would schedule its oscillators against a context that is not running yet and
 * be inaudible, even for a reader who had been clicking around the app for
 * twenty minutes and whose gesture requirement was long since satisfied. The
 * sound then worked from the SECOND notification onward, which is indelicate to
 * notice and reads as "it's unreliable".
 *
 * Doing it on a real gesture instead means the context is `running` before
 * anything needs it, and the first notification sounds like the rest.
 *
 * ## It deliberately makes no sound
 *
 * A silent warm-up, not a test tone. Playing something on first click would be
 * a noise the reader did not ask for, at the moment they are least expecting
 * one.
 *
 * Registered regardless of the sound PREFERENCE: somebody who enables the
 * toggle later has, by clicking the toggle, already interacted — but the
 * context has to exist for that click to help, and building it here costs one
 * suspended context and no audio.
 *
 * Safe to call from several components; the listeners attach once. Returns a
 * cleanup for the caller's effect.
