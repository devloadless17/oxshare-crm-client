/**
 * Where the chosen language is remembered.
 *
 * TWIN FILE — an identical copy lives at the same path in `oxshare-crm-admin`.
 *
 * The convention is the one every i18n stack uses and the one this platform's
 * reference CRM uses: a single localStorage key holding the language tag
 * (`i18nextLng` there), read on boot, written when the user chooses. Ours is
 * namespaced to match the theme key already in use (`oxshare-*-theme` via
 * next-themes) so one app's preferences cannot collide with another OxShare
 * site's on a shared registrable domain — the same reasoning that drove the
 * cookie names in the backend's session-cookies.ts.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS BEFORE THE SWITCHER DOES
 *
 * `docs/CLAUDE.md` says not to build the language switcher yet, and this is not
 * one — there is no UI here. What it buys is that RTL becomes TESTABLE: set the
 * key in devtools, reload, and the layout either mirrors correctly or it does
 * not. Without it, `direction()` is a function nobody can exercise and the
 * Arabic layout sweep stays theoretical until the day it is urgent.
 *
 * `localStorage`, not a cookie: this is a display preference, it is not sent to
 * the API, and it should outlive the session — the same lifetime `theme-mode`
 * already has. It is deliberately NOT in the session cookie jar, which holds
 * credentials.
